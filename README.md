Fighter!
========
It's called Fighter, but I don't really know what I
want it to end up being. Right now this is my
"figure out the SNES" repo.

Credit goes to UnDisbeliever for some of
the framework going on inside the code
(bass magic and all), and to tepples for
pretty much all of the code in some
sense or another.

If you're wondering what the deal is with
fighter.sym, that's designed to work with
[BenjaminSchulte's fork of bsnes-plus.](https://github.com/BenjaminSchulte/bsnes-plus)
The SNES.BLABLABLA definitions are added by
the emulator itself, and it also orders the
labels numerically.
